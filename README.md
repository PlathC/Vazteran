Vulkan based viewer for learning purposes. This aims to make available a simpler way 
to render my potential future test related to computer graphics. 

Here is the roadmap :
| Feature                                                         | Progress  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Render Graph                                                    | WIP       |
| Ui Library                                                      | WIP       |
| Geometry helping library                                        | To Do     |
| ECS                                                             | To Do     |

## Current state

The engine can now load 3D models and present it with an hardcoded phong that will be extended in order to use uniform data.
